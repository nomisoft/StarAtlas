# Star Atlas

This is the initial, unfinished, work on a rebuild of staratlas.co.uk. The original site was built as a university project over a decade ago. The plan for the rebuild is to bring it up to date with more modern PHP concepts and provide a publicly available API to fetch star and planetary information.

Note: Unit tests are not currently all passing
